<h1>Analyzing DJ Set Flow and Music Diversity at Austin Westie Academy</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project focuses on collecting and analyzing data from all DJs who have performed weekly at Austin Westie Academy. To sustain and grow our dance community, it is essential to provide a dynamic musical experience that aligns with the rhythm and timing of West Coast Swing—which traditionally follows a 4/4 time signature.
<br />
<br />
The dataset explores how each DJ's set progresses throughout the night, assessing whether dancers are exposed to a diverse range of music styles, genres, and BPM (beats per minute). According to standard DJ guidelines, an effective set should exhibit gradual BPM fluctuations, following a sinusoidal pattern to maintain energy flow and engagement.
<br />
<br />
By visualizing this data, we can evaluate how closely each DJ's set adheres to this optimal structure, identify potential imbalances in genre distribution, and determine whether certain BPM ranges are overused or underrepresented. These insights not only enhance the dancer’s experience but also provide a data-driven approach to identifying top-performing DJs, enabling us to make informed decisions about future bookings and curating more engaging social dance events.
